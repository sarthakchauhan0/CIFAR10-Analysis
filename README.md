In this project, we explored three different machine learning approaches for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Bayesian Classifier with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features, and a k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. The goal was to analyze and compare the performance of statistical methods and neural networks for image classification tasks.
The CNN model was built using Keras, consisting of multiple convolutional, batch normalization, max-pooling, and dropout layers, followed by a fully connected dense layer. The model achieved a test accuracy of 86.98%. In contrast, the Bayesian Classifier used PCA for feature extraction and either parametric estimation or Parzen's technique for estimating the probability density function of the classes, achieving an accuracy of 52.17%. The KNN classifier employed a Euclidean metric with k=5 neighbors and the 'brute' algorithm. The KNN model resulted in a test accuracy of 33.38%.
The comparison of the results revealed that CNN outperformed the Bayesian Classifier and KNN classifier by a significant margin. This can be attributed to the ability of CNNs to automatically learn hierarchical features from the data, which is particularly useful for image classification tasks. On the other hand, statistical methods such as Bayesian Classifier and KNN classifier rely heavily on handcrafted features, like PCA, and do not exploit the spatial structure of the images as effectively.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that the CNN approach works best for the CIFAR-10 image classification task, achieving significantly higher accuracy than the other methods. This highlights the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for complex image recognition problems, as opposed to traditional statistical methods.
